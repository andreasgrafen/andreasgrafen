_“[…] just a regular everyday normal guy”_ doing design and code thingies. ![Code Development](/images/code_development.svg)

I keep a close eye on design trends and new techs. Always keen on new challenges, I spent the past few years digging into design principles and web technologies.

I create interfaces and identities mostly with good old Photoshop or Illustrator. I also build websites and webapps using HTML, CSS and JS as well as Frameworks like Vue or CMS like Contenido, Wordpress or Kirby. While webdesign is my first love I also enjoy doing motiongraphics/videography (or reading a good book).
