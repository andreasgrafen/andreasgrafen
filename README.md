## Hello there! I'm Andreas. c:
»_[…] just a regular everyday normal guy_« from Germany who is working on design and code thingies – well, sometimes. Here is a little something about myself:

<br><br><br>

Always quite keen on new challenes I spent the past years digging into design principles and web technologies. Since the world of the web is ever-evolving and I'm eager to learn I still keep a close eye on design trends and new tech.

In day-to-day life I create **websites** and **webapps** using **HTML** and Pug, **CSS** and SASS, and modern **Javascript** as well as frameworks like Vue and React. I also know my way around in CMS like Contenido or Wordpress. I love to challenge myself to find new ways to layout content in interesting in intricate ways – who wants to have boring websites, right? Besides frontend development I'm also interested in automating processes with the help of **Python** and **Node**; I sometimes even touch some **PHP** for server-side implementations.

Other than that I'm big into privacy and cyber security as those topic are some of the most relevant in our modern world, based on that I'm an avid Linux nerd. Outside the tech-space (or well… partly) I enjoy Video Games, some good music, or really just a good book.
