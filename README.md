Hi! I'm Andreas – “[…] just a regular everyday normal guy” working on design and code thingies.

#### This is what I do:
Always keen on new challenges I spent the past years digging into design principles and web technologies and since there is always something new to learn I still keep a close eye on design trends and new tech.

In day to day life I create websites and webapps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as frameworks like Vue and React, and CMS like Contenido, Wordpress or Kirby. I also love to design sites myself and I like to challenge myself finding new ways to layout content in interesting and intricate ways.

While webdesign is definitely my first love I also enjoy doing motiongraphics and videography or just reading a good book.
