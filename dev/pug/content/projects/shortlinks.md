### Shorter Links with PHP

A simple shortlink generator — _like bit.ly_ — written in **PHP**. This just exists because we had a funny domain (ヅ.xyz) on hand and no other idea what we could to with it. But everytime we have a short link for something it also smiles at you.

While the domain sadly isn't active anymore I still use the code on a different domain for private use.
