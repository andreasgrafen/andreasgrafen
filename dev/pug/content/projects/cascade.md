### Cascade – a minimal userChome.css

**Cascade** is a Firefox Theme based on [SimpleFox](https://github.com/migueravila/SimpleFox). The theme was known previously as »_ag.proton_« — but let's be honest: That sounds hella boring.

What you get is a really simple adaptive layout that works well with the new Proton UI. On larger window resolutions it will have a oneline layout which displays the URL bar and tab list next to each other. Smaller resultions will stack both UI elements on top of each other for better readability.
