### My personal Website

That's the beauty **you're currently visiting** – My personal website is something that represents myself. It's a place where I can play around with different ideas and designs. That's probably why it's usually due to a rework in a regular basis…

The current version was finished by pulling an all-nighter in early 2022. Let's see how long I'll be happy with this, or what little tweaks (or complete redesigns) I'll come up with in the future.

Who knows… maybe if you'll come beack tomorrow things have already changed?
