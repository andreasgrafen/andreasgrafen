### Ninja â€“ a fun Discord-bot

**Ninja** is a simple **Chatbot for Discord**. It comes with quite a few commands since I used this project to get familiar with **Python**. It's basically a lot of API requests bundled up with a little bit of image manipulation and other basic Python stuff sprinkled in.

It was a really fun project, and the bot still brings joy to a couple small communities to this day. I also have some ideas for some more commands, but I haven't gotten around to actually implement then.

**All the [mess](https://github.com/unseen-ninja/discord-ninja) is avaible too**
