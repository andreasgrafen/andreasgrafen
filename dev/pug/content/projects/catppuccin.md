### Catppuccin â€” pastel colours for the masses

**Catppuccin** is a _community-driven_ pastel theme that aims to be the middle ground between low and high contrast themes. It consists of a soothing warm palette with **22 eye-candy colours** perfect for coding, designing, and much more!

Originally created by [Pocco81](https://github.com/Pocco81); my contributions consist of various little tweaks of the colours themselves, as well as some ports for different apps. I also manage some of the community submissions.
